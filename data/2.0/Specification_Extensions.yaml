Specification Extensions:
  name: ^x-
  type: Any
  patterned: true
  openapiType: true
  description: |
    While the OpenAPI Specification tries to accommodate most use cases, additional data can be added to extend the specification at certain points.  
    The field name MUST begin with *x-*, for example, *x-internal-id.*  
    The value can be null, a primitive, an array or an object.  
    When the value is an object or an array of object, the object's fields names do not need to start with *x-*.  
    The extensions may or may not be supported by the available tooling, but those may be extended as well to add requested support (if tools are internal or open-sourced).
