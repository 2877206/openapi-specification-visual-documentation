      - Better control on media type, response handles returned media type with `content.{mediatype}`. It replaces `produces` definition on `Operation Object` or top level.
      - Enhanced hypermedia design with `links`.
      - Headers are easier to define because they can be defined in `components.headers` and used in `headers`
