        Specifies the OpenAPI Specification version being used. It can be used by tooling Specifications and clients to interpret the version. The structure SHALL be `major.minor.patch`, where `patch` versions MUST be compatible with the existing `major.minor` tooling. Typically `patch` versions will be introduced to address errors in the documentation, and tooling SHOULD typically be compatible with the corresponding `major.minor` (3.0.*). Patch versions will correspond to patches of this document.
