Schema Object:
  description: |
    The Schema Object allows the definition of input and output data types. These types can be objects, but also primitives and arrays. This object is an extended subset of the [JSON Schema Specification Wright Draft 00](http://json-schema.org/).

    Further information about the properties can be found in [JSON Schema Core](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wright-json-schema-00) and [JSON Schema Validation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wright-json-schema-validation-00). Unless stated otherwise, the property definitions follow the JSON Schema specification as referenced here.

    Alternatively, any time a Schema Object can be used, a Reference Object can be used in its place. This allows referencing definitions in place of defining them inline.

    Additional properties defined by the JSON Schema specification that are not mentioned here are strictly unsupported.
