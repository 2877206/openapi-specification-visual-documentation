Header Object:
  description: |
    The Header Object follows the structure of the Parameter Object, with the following changes:

    - name MUST NOT be specified, it is given in the Headers Object.
    - in MUST NOT be specified, it is implicitly in header.
    - All traits that are affected by the location MUST follow the location of header (for example, style).

    Note: allowEmptyValue shouldn't be used too (only for query parameters)

      name: <using style and schema>
      type: Parameter Object Style Schema
      description: The rules for serialization of the parameter are specified in one of two ways. For simpler scenarios, a style and schema can be used to describe the structure and syntax of the parameter.

      name: <using content>
      type: Parameter Object Content
      description: For more complex scenarios a Content Object can be used to define the media type and schema of the parameter. This option is mutually exclusive with the simple scenario above. When example or examples are provided in conjunction with the schema object, the example must follow the prescribed serialization strategy for the parameter.
