Links Object:
  description: |
    The links object represents a set of possible design-time links for a response. The presence of a link does not guarantee the caller's ability to successfully invoke it, rather it provides a known relationship and traversal mechanism between responses and other operations.

    As opposed to dynamic links (links provided in the response payload), the OAS linking mechanism does not require that link information be provided in a specific response format at runtime.

    For computing links, and providing instructions to execute them, variable substitution is used for accessing values in a response and using them as values while invoking the linked operation.
