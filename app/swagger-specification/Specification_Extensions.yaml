Specification Extensions:
  name: ^x-
  type: Any
  patterned: true
  swaggerType: true
  description: |
    While the Swagger Specification tries to accommodate most use cases, additional data can be added to extend the specification at certain points.
    The field name MUST begin with x-, for example, x-internal-id.
    The value can be null, a primitive, an array or an object.
    The extensions may or may not be supported by the available tooling, but those may be extended as well to add requested support (if tools are internal or open-sourced).
