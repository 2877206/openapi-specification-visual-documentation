Schema Object:
  description: |
    The Schema Object allows the definition of input and output data types.
    These types can be objects, but also primitives and arrays.
    This object is based on the JSON Schema Specification Draft 4 and uses a predefined subset of it.
    On top of this subset, there are extensions provided by this specification to allow for more complete documentation.

        The following properties are taken from the JSON Schema definition but their definitions were adjusted to the Swagger Specification.  
        Their definition is the same as the one from JSON Schema, only where the original definition references the JSON Schema definition, the Schema Object definition is used instead.
