Parameter Object:
  description: |
    Describes a single operation parameter.
    A unique parameter is defined by a combination of a name and location (in).
  allowExtension: true
  fields:
    -
      name: in
      type: string
      description: The location of the parameter.
      values:
        -
          value: query
          description: "Parameters that are appended to the URL.  For example, in */items?id=value*, the query parameter is id."
        -
          value: header
          description: Custom headers that are expected as part of the request.
        -
          value: path
          description: |
            Used together with Path Templating, where the parameter value is actually part of the operation's URL.
            This does not include the host or base path of the API.
            For example, in */items/{itemId}*, the path parameter is itemId.
        -
          value: formData
          description: |
            Used to describe the payload of an HTTP request when either *application/x-www-form-urlencoded* or *multipart/form-data* are used as the content type of the request (in Swagger's definition, the consumes property of an operation).
            This is the only parameter type that can be used to send files, thus supporting the file type.
            Since form parameters are sent in the payload, they cannot be declared together with a body parameter for the same operation.
            Form parameters have a different format based on the content-type used (for further details, consult http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4):

              - application/x-www-form-urlencoded - Similar to the format of Query parameters but as a payload.  For example, foo=1&bar=swagger - both foo and bar are form parameters. This is normally used for simple parameters that are being transferred.
              - multipart/form-data - Each parameter takes a section in the payload with an internal header.  For example, for the header Content-Disposition: form-data; name="submit-name" the name of the parameter is submit-name. This type of form parameters is more commonly used for file transfers.
        -
          value: body
          description: |
            The payload that's appended to the HTTP request.
            Since there can only be one payload, there can only be one body parameter.
            The name of the body parameter has no effect on the parameter itself and is used for documentation purposes only.
            Since Form parameters are also in the payload, body and form parameters cannot exist together for the same operation.
    -
      name: <in is body>
      type: Parameter Object Body
      description: Fields if *in* value is *body*.
    -
      name: <in is not body>
      type: Parameter Object Not Body
      description: Fields if *in* value is *query*, *header*, *path* or *formData*.
    -
      name: description
      type: string
      gfm: true
      description: |
        A brief description of the parameter.
        This could contain examples of use.
    -
      name: required
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Determines whether this parameter is mandatory.
        If the parameter is in *path*, this property is required and its value MUST be true.
        Otherwise, the property MAY be included and its default value is false.
